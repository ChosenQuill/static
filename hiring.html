						<p class="lead">Thank you for taking your time to consider helping us or just wondering what we do. It means a lot for a couple minuites of your time.</p>

						<h2>Basic Info</h2>
												
						<h3>
						I am a programmer, website owner and designer, video editor, and a starting youtuber. </h3><p>I am creating a small group of graphical designers, app designers (web designers could be usefull here), 1-2 extra programmers, and some video editors. Even though I have bairly anything right now, I hope to make it into something great over the years. I do not want money. I want to give back to the community and just make someone smile or even learn something new. Even if you can't help me, leading me to someone or somewhere where I can find people to help me would mean a lot. Still confused? Scroll Down to the Still Confused section.
						</p>
						<h4>Need:</h4><p>
						I need graphic designers, and app designers (web designers could also do the task) for logos, app designs, game assets, and cool art. I want to find people who can work with me in the long term but even a small contribution or helping for a short amount of time would be amazing. This project is very large so you will most likely have something you want to do.
						</p><h4>
						Willing to pay:</h4><p>
						As I said before, I AM NOT LOOKING FOR MONEY. Any money I earn whenever will be given to the person who helped me with that project. If multiple people help me, I will split it based off of who worked with me the most. That saying, if you are looking for a constant source of money, I am not the person. Most of my projects will be based on being free for the people who want to use it. (If I made everything I did paid, how can I give back to the community?)
						</p><h4></h4>
						Specifics and Time Frame:</h4><p>
						You choose what you want to do and how long you want to do it. Any help I can get is greatly valued. Even if you want to just create a logo over the timespan of 2 months, I would be happy that you are there to help.
						</p><p>
						If you would like to help me, please follow the contacts at the bottom of the page. I will reply as soon as possible.
						</p>
						<h2>Still Confused? Here is a longer explanation.</h2>
						<p>My goal is to give back to the community and just make someone smile or even learn something new. As of right now, I am covering a Website, A Youtube Channel, App Development, and probally more which I can't think of at the moment. I have most of the certificates, documents, and developing tools required to start and if I don't right now, I intend on getting them in the future. The problem is that programming apps, creating PC games using Java, using HTML to design a website, creating videos and animations, editing and rendering the videos, creating content for the website, creating music gets hard to do. (Yes, that is long list. The sad truth is that is only a small portion of what I am trying to do.). I can try to do my best to manage everything, but right now, it is getting hard to do. I thought why not reach out to the community to get some help. I never thought I would get as much support as quick. Right now, I am looking to rework some of my old/worse artwork with new and better art. After I finally get that finished up, we can start the content creating phase, where I will get some more help so that we can support the larger workload. As I said before, most of this work is based on being free to the community so I don't expect to gain anything in return. Even if I do earn some money, I will give it to the team for supporting me. Some of the content we produce such as the apps may include premium paid features and the people who helped me on the projects will be paid.</p>
